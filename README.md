Button 2 takes you to Activity C when clicked. Activity B is the About ALC page, it contains only a Webview that loads the URL https://andela.com/alc/ which is the ALC about page. Activity C is your profile, it contains an ImageView which should display your photo, TextViews showing your name, Track, Country, Email and Phone Number.
